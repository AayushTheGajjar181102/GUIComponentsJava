# GUIComponentsJava

// Adding a component in a Jframe is being a redundant and also very boring.

// Now, new Component instantiation, setBounds, setText, addEvent, addToFrame all is can be done through single function.

// just one line and boom!! add components with only one line, it will also set layout automatically.

// Currently it's working with JLabel, JTextField, JButton, JCheckBox and JPasswordField.

// Examples on main.src

// Here, JLabel = label, JTextField = input, JButton = button, JCheckbox = checkbox, JPasswordField = password
